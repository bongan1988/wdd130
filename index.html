                    I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Development through the BYU Pathway program, developing
                    a solid foundation
                    in software engineering principles, object-oriented programming, database systems, web technologies,
                    and system
                    architecture. I am passionate about solving complex technical challenges, debugging and optimizing
                    code, and designing
                    efficient, scalable, and maintainable solutions. My objective is to broaden my technical expertise
                    by working across
                    multiple programming languages, frameworks, and development environments, while gaining hands-on
                    experience in
                    real-world projects that enhance both my analytical thinking and engineering capabilities.
